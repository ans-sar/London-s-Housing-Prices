As the London housing market continues to evolve, understanding what drives property prices is crucial for investors, homebuyers, and policymakers. In my recent project, I conducted an in-depth analysis of 3,480 properties using Python, exploring the factors that impact house prices. Here’s what I uncovered:

 Key Insights:

Property Type Matters: Penthouses and houses have the highest median prices, while studios and flats tend to be more affordable.

Price Variations: Significant price variations exist within property types, especially in flats and new developments, often influenced by location and amenities.

Impact of Outliers: Luxury properties skew the average price significantly, highlighting the importance of removing outliers to better understand typical market trends.

 What I Analyzed:

House prices by property size, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms.
The impact of outliers on the overall price distribution.
Trends across different London neighborhoods and property types.
Why This Matters: Understanding these trends helps buyers and investors make informed decisions, especially in a competitive market like London. This analysis can also inform policy development and urban planning by highlighting key areas that demand attention.
