Unlocking the Secrets Behind London’s Housing Prices: A Data-Driven Analysis
As the London housing market continues to evolve, understanding what drives property prices is crucial for investors, homebuyers, and policymakers. In my recent project, I conducted an in-depth analysis of 3,480 properties using Python, exploring the factors that impact house prices. Here’s what I uncovered:
 Key Insights:
•	Property Type Matters: Penthouses and houses have the highest median prices, while studios and flats tend to be more affordable.
•	Price Variations: Significant price variations exist within property types, especially in flats and new developments, often influenced by location and amenities.
•	Impact of Outliers: Luxury properties skew the average price significantly, highlighting the importance of removing outliers to better understand typical market trends.
 What I Analyzed:
•	House prices by property size, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms.
•	The impact of outliers on the overall price distribution.
•	Trends across different London neighbourhood and property types.
 Why This Matters: Understanding these trends helps buyers and investors make informed decisions, especially in a competitive market like London. This analysis can also inform policy development and urban planning by highlighting key areas that demand attention.
Next Steps: In future analyses, I aim to dive deeper into the impact of proximity to transport hubs and schools, and examine how neighbourhood amenities influence property prices.
